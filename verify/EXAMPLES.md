## Summary: The Pattern

```
1. ANALYZE the query
   - What domain(s)?
   - Time-sensitive?
   - Volatility signals?

2. CLASSIFY each element
   - Verify: volatile, post-cutoff, specific numbers/versions
   - Trust: timeless, established, foundational

3. EXECUTE verification for volatile elements
   - Use appropriate tools (WebSearch, Context7, WebFetch)
   - Target authoritative sources

4. SYNTHESIZE response
   - Combine verified current info with stable training
   - Show reasoning
   - Flag uncertainties
   - Point to authoritative sources for high-stakes topics

5. DISCLAIM appropriately
   - Medical/legal/financial → professional consultation
   - Evolving situations → may have changed
   - Statistics → as of [date]
```
